# CPP-Data-Structures-and-Algorithms

Repository I created for myself to learn C++ while also going into a deep dive on how different data structures and algorithims work at a low level.

## List of different Data Structers and Algorithms to keep track of what I have done so far, along with Leetcode questions relating to them I have done:
#### Linked Lists:
 - https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/
 - https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/
 - https://leetcode.com/problems/reorder-list/
 - https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-nth-node-from-end-of-list/
 - https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle/
 - https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-k-sorted-lists/
 #### Binary Trees:                                                         // My solutions
